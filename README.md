# COMP0034 Week 7 Starter code and activities

This repository contains the following exercises:

1. [Create a base Jinja2 template and inherit in other pages](activities/1_create_base_jinja_template.md)
2. [Create a signup form using Flask-WTF](activities/2_create_signup_form.md)
3. [Enable Flask flash messaging](activities/3_enable_flash_messaging.md)
4. [Database interaction](activities/4_database_interaction.md)
5. [Lab 7](activities/lab7.md)

You could complete the activities using the starter code in `my_flask_app`, however if you created your own Flask app
from the activities last week then it is preferable to continue from that.

If you use the starter code in `my_flask_app` please note you may need to check your IDEs project settings to ensure it
is enabled for Flask and Jinja2 and that the templates folder is recognised as such in the project structure.

If you wish to see a completed example after activities 1 - 4 have been completed then look at code in `example_app`.

## Set-up

1. Create a repository by using
   the [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

    - Type a name for the repo
